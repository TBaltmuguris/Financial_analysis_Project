## Financial_analysis_Project

This project was done in order to show my financial analysis skills in addition to simple data analysis things that every data analyst learns in Turing College, to potentially show a little side of me and my interests additionally to an interest to create a database of my own instead of taking an already existing one. I like data analysis, and if I can unite that with the finance side of things, I tend to really enjoy the projects that I am working on. 

This project was created with a hypothetical assumption that a PE fund would come to me with a want to invest in a Baltic car dealer and it would be my task to examine the best possible investment option. I completely understand that a PE company wouldn't take on a business this small, but it was still fun to do this project nevertheless.
